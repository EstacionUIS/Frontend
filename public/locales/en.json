        "Title": "About this project",
        "Description": "This project details the implementation of a ground station based on software-defined radio (SDR) at the School of Electrical, Electronic and Telecommunications Engineering (E3T) of the Industrial University of Santander. The initiative arises from the lack of access to updated satellite data and images, attributed to the absence of a functional ground station. By reactivating this station, it is incorporated into the network of satNOGS ground stations, being the first active one in Bucaramanga."
